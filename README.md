# React Native Project

For this assignment at VefskÃ³linn we were supposed to explore frameworks to create an app for smartphones. I chose to explore React Native and Expo.

## Venue recommendations

My initial idea was to create an app which shows you all restaurants near you on a map and in a list. I didn't have much options in API's with reastaurants in Iceland. The best one probably would have been Google places but for that you need a billing account which I chose not to do. Then I found the Foursquare venue API which has many Icelandic venues. For free use I could just get venue recommendations API so that's not a complete list. Also there are limited information about each venue so I didn't get everything I wanted from it e.g. images, logo and url. I had a limited time for this assignment and that's why it's very simple, far from a complete app. I don't have a name or logo and the styling is minimal. There are two pages, List View and Map View, the first one is List View and you will get prompt for your location and if you approve then you will get a list of venue recommendations with food, coffie and drinks. You will see a loading screen while waiting for the list to render. Each list item shows the name of the venue, address, type and distance from your location. There is a button to go over to Map View and there you will see your location on the map and markers for each venue. When you press a marker you will see a popup with the venue name and type.

## Future vision

- Getting a complete list of venues and more info for each one
- Beeing able to filter by venue type
- Getting directions on the map
- ... and so much more you could do with this kind of map
